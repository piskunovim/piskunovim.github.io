            <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

            <p>
              We live in a time when lots of devices pass through our hands. I
              think there are two main reasons for this: the fast technological
              progress and the constant search for a device that would satisfy
              our needs.
            </p>

            <p>
              I work a lot on the computer and for me, choosing the right
              keyboard was a long process. It was a frustrating experience
              typing on membrane keyboards, and it was sleepless nights for my
              loved ones due to the loud clicks of mechanical keyboards.
            </p>

            <p>
              So it was until one day the Logitech MX Keys keyboard fell into my
              hands, and since then it has become the main keyboard in my house.
              Today, I am the happy owner of three keyboards of the MX Keys
              series:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Logitech MX Keys,ft</li>
              <li>Logitech MX Keys Mini,</li>
              <li>Logitech Craft.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>

              />
            </p>

            <p>Let’s talk about what makes me interested in these keyboards.</p>

            <hr />

            <h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>

            <p>There are three main advantages I see in all MX keyboards:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Quiet key travel.</li>
              <li>Ability to connect to three different devices.</li>
              <li>Wireless connection.</li>
              <li>Long-life battery.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              No matter which version you choose, you can be sure that these
              functions will be provided with due comfort. By choosing the
              version you’re choosing between the form, the weight and some
              unusual features that I cannot mark as advantages. Let’s try to
              briefly describe each version.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img

            <p>
              <strong>Logitech MX Keys</strong> is a balanced full-scale
              keyboard. It looks and feels great. Weight is average. Connection
              technology: Logitech Unifying (I’ll tell you a little later, this
              is important).
            </p>

                width="480"
              />
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Logitech MX Keys Mini</strong> is a minimized version of
              the MX Keys. Numpad has been removed, the main letter keys haven’t
              been touched, and the bottom row of the keyboard has been more
              tightly packed. The weight is light. Connectivity technology:
              Bluetooth.
            </p>

                width="480"
              />
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Logitech Craft</strong> is a copy of the Logitech MX Keys,
              weighted down in my opinion an absolutely useless feature called
              “crown” (an input dial that you won’t use even in those cases
              where it’s implied). The main idea behind the crown is to use it
              in the area of digital design and video editing. But in fact, it
              doesn’t provide functions that could replace convenient editor
              shortcuts. Moreover, the crown takes extra space and adds weight
              to the device. As a result, the weight turned out to be heavy, and
              it’s hard not to notice. Connectivity technology: Logitech
              Unifying.

              About connectivity technologies
            </h3>

            <p>
              Let’s talk about two facts that apply to all MX keyboards we’re
              talking about today:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>You can connect all these keyboards via Bluetooth.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>You cannot use any of these keyboards as wired ones.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              The first item in the list means a lot of devices that you’re able
              to connect easily. And the second one…well…means that we have an
              issue on BIOS[POST] step when the Bluetooth driver isn’t loaded
              yet.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some motherboards support Bluetooth loading in POST, but it will
              cost you extra money. Logitech MX Keys and Logitech Craft have a
              resolution to this issue called Logitech’s Unifying technology.
              All you need to do is to plug in the USB dongle from the kit
              inside your computer and the keyboards will be available in BIOS.
            </p>

            <p>
              Until this year, MX Keys Mini had no workaround. It’s truly a
              Bluetooth keyboard and cannot be connected by using “unifying”
              technology. That meant, in order to use the keyboard in BIOS, you
              just need another keyboard. But in 2022 with the new Logitech MX
              Mechanical Keyboard, the new dongle (Logi Bolt) was announced
              which is designed to solve the big problem of a small device. So
              now, if you have MX Keys Mini, I strictly recommend thinking about
              getting this dongle.
            </p>

                width="200"
              />
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                The first one (orange) is “Unifying” receiver and the second one
                (green) is “Logi Bolt”
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              By the way, Logitech Unifying technology also saves battery life,
              so the keyboard will work longer without charge (Logi Bolt
              marketing also states that).
            </p>

            <p>
              All keyboards on a single charge last approximately 14 days. You
              are more likely to forget when you last charged it. The time frame
              between charges is really impressive.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

            <p>
              In terms of form factor, I’d personally choose the MX Keys Mini.
              It’s a great keyboard for travelling, it has all the main features
              of the MX Keys series, it’s ultimately comfortable to use, and it
              takes up little space at home. But! The BIOS doesn’t work out of
              the box (don’t forget about Logi Bolt, but that means additional
              investment).
            </p>

            <p>
              The most balanced option is MX Keys. Yes, I’m repeating it again,
              it’s great and that’s true. It’s full-scaled, it’s still
              lightweight, and it works in BIOS. But the personal preference for
              more compact devices makes this device number two on my list.
            </p>

            <p>
              And, I’m sorry, but the Logitech Craft is rubbish. Frankly, it’s
              not so different from the MX Keys, but you have to pay extra money
              for the noticeable weight, additional space at the top of the
              keyboard, and, of course, for the “crown” spinner. And that’s not
              fair.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>And the winner is MX Keys Mini!</strong> Just because in
              my case, the form factor makes more sense than BIOS usage. And
              again, with Logi Bolt this issue should be resolved. I’ll make a
              note about it if I’ll get one. Just look again, how does MX Keys
              Mini looks like on the table:

            <p>
              PS #1: Some people say that MX Key keyboards has a proverbial
              slant. That’s true, but in fact, you won’t notice it. I didn’t
              until someone told me about that.
